twisted-socks -- Client SOCKS support in Twisted.

Twisted[0] doesn't seem to have support for writing a SOCKS client.
The SOCKS support is written for servers and is restricted to SOCKSv4.

This package aims to add support for client TCP connections, with or
without SSL/TLS, to go over a SOCKS proxy, version 4, 4a or 5.

See the examples directory for an idea on how to use it.  You can
start a SOCKSv4 proxy server in the foreground by issuing the command
  twistd -n socks
Might be good for testing.


Thanks to lebek for the Twisted magic needed to hook this in.

This package is being maintained by linus@nordberg.se.  Its canonical
pickup point is http://github.com/ln5/twisted-socks .
